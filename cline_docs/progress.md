# Progress: Puppeteer PDF Service

## What works

The following endpoints are confirmed to be working correctly:

1. **`GET /health`**
   - âœ… WORKS
   - Returns a status check that the service is running
   - Example response: `{"status": "ok", "message": "Puppeteer service is running"}`

2. **`GET /`**
   - âœ… WORKS
   - Simple root endpoint for testing
   - Example response: `{"status": "ok", "message": "Puppeteer service root"}`
   
3. **`GET /get-latest-pdf`**
   - âœ… WORKS
   - Returns the URL of the most recently generated PDF
   - Example response: `{"latestPdf": "/output/presentation-8234f5dc-1a23-4567-b89c-0d1e2f3a4b5c.pdf"}`

4. **`POST /screenshot`**
   - âœ… WORKS
   - Generates a screenshot from HTML content
   - Takes HTML content and optional dimensions as input
   - Returns a URL to the generated screenshot

5. **`POST /screenshots`**
   - âœ… WORKS
   - Generates screenshots from multiple URLs
   - Takes an array of URLs and dimension settings
   - Returns an array of paths to the generated screenshots

6. **`POST /generate-pdf`**
   - âœ… FIXED
   - Generates a PDF from server-side image paths
   - Previously had issues with file path resolution
   - Now works correctly with proper path handling

7. **`POST /export-slides`**
   - âœ… FIXED
   - One-step process to generate a PDF from slide URLs
   - Previously had issues with URL construction
   - Now works correctly with proper URL patterns

## What's left to build/fix

All endpoints are now working correctly. We have fixed the previously identified issues:

1. **`POST /generate-pdf`**
   - âœ… FIXED
   - Previous problem: Required server-side paths to images with path resolution issues
   - Solution: Corrected path handling and slide file naming conventions
   - Note: This endpoint still requires server-side file paths, which is a limitation for public API usage

2. **`POST /export-slides`**
   - âœ… FIXED
   - Previous problem: Issues with slide URLs and path construction
   - Solution: Updated URL patterns to use the correct format (`http://localhost:3002/slide/{number}`)
   - Note: For production use, ensure slides are available at consistent URLs
