# Active Context: Puppeteer PDF Service

## What we're working on now

We are currently working on troubleshooting issues with the PDF generation endpoints in the Puppeteer PDF Service. Specifically, there are problems with:

1. The `/generate-pdf` endpoint - This endpoint requires server-side paths to images but has path reference issues
2. The `/export-slides` endpoint - This endpoint has issues with slide URL handling

Our primary goal is to debug these endpoints, understand the root causes of the failures, and implement fixes that make them reliable.

## Recent changes

We've made the following changes to fix the PDF generation issues:

1. Identified and resolved inconsistent slide file naming and URL patterns:
   - The test-server.js serves slides at `/slide/{number}` and expects files named `slide1.html` (without hyphen)
   - The test-slides.js was creating slides named `slide-1.html` (with hyphen) and using different URLs
   - The error message `Cannot GET /public/test-slides/slidel.html` was caused by this path mismatch
   
2. Updated the test-slides.js script to:
   - Create slides with both naming conventions (`slide1.html` and `slide-1.html`) to support all tests
   - Use the correct URL pattern (`http://localhost:3002/slide/1` instead of custom URLs)
   - Enhance slide content with larger, better-quality images for improved PDF appearance
   - Use consistent 1920x1080 dimensions for optimal display

3. Tested both problematic endpoints:
   - The `/generate-pdf` endpoint now correctly converts images to PDF
   - The `/export-slides` endpoint now correctly captures slides and generates a PDF in one step

## Next steps

1. **Documentation updates**:
   - Update the README.md to reflect the correct usage patterns
   - Add examples of proper slide URL formats
   - Document the fixed endpoints and their requirements

2. **Additional testing**:
   - Test with different dimensions and content types to ensure robustness
   - Verify performance with larger slide sets
   - Test with various client implementations

3. **Future improvements**:
   - Consider modifying the `/generate-pdf` endpoint to accept public image URLs instead of server-side paths
   - Add support for customizing PDF metadata (title, author, etc.)
   - Implement additional PDF options (orientation, margins, etc.)
   - Add more robust error handling and user feedback
   - Improve logging for debugging purposes
